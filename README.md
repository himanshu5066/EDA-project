Project Overview :-
    This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real estate pricing to uncover factors influencing house valuations in a dynamic market. Using statistical 
    techniques and visualizations, we analyze the dataset to guide pricing strategy and inform decision-making in property acquisition and sales.

Dataset :-
The "Housing Data.csv" file includes various property attributes such as location, size, amenities, and historical transaction data, all critical for understanding pricing dynamics.

Analysis Steps :-
  . Data Loading and Cleaning the data
  . Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
  . Handle missing values, duplicates, and anomalies.
  
Univariate Analysis:-
Explore individual variables (e.g., house prices) using histograms and kernel density plots.

Multivariate Analysis:-
Analyze relationships between variables like bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage with pricing.

Feature Engineering:-
Generate new features such as price per square foot and property age.

Market Trends Analysis:-
Use time-series data to examine historical pricing trends and assess economic influences.

Customer Preferences:-
Analyze how amenities impact pricing and group properties by similar features using clustering.

Libraries Used 
 . Pandas for data manipulation.
 . Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
 .  Numpy for data handling and numerical analysis.
